# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Client menu options was added.

* Some announcements are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

We decided to create a new class called ListingRequestController to handle the creation of a new request. This class is responsible for creating a new request and saving it in the repository. We also decided to create a new method called randomAgent() to generate a random agent from the list of employees based on the given agency. This method is used to assign a random agent to the request.
